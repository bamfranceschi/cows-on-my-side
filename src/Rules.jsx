        Split the car lengthways: you've got a Left team and a Right team.
        Awkward middle seat must choose sides. Choose wisely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each team has their territory, corresponding with their side of the car.
        Left team, you get the left side of the road. Right team, you get right.
      </li>
      <li>
        You must claim herds of cattle that appear in your territory before the
        other team claims them. If you claim yours first, you score a point.
        Should you fail, you lose a point.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you think you saw a cow, but it was in fact a horse, bale of hay, old
        tractor, UFO, etc., your team loses 5 points.
      </li>
      <li>
        Herds are divided by fences. Like Highlander, THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE herd
        per fenced field. Insert bad highland cow pun here.
      </li>
      <li>Don't crash.</li>
    </ul>
